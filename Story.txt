Once along a year there is a rabbit and a tortoise lived in a Forest.
One day the rabbit sayed to tortoise that I am very fast than you and you cann't defeat me in a race. 
Tortoise didn't like what rabbit sayed then he angrilly challenged rabbit to a race.
They choose paroot as their referee.
As the race started rabbit had the huge lead.
The tortoise was barely able to walk but he was trying his best.
When rabbit was about to reach the destination we felt tired and he think that tortoise is very far away and he cann't win
so he decided to tak a small nap.
Tortoise was trying is best.
As the time goes on tortoise was about to reach the end point wheras rabbit was still asleep.
Then tortoise won the race and rabbit felt guilty for what he said to tortoise.
Then he sayed sorry to him and afterwards they lived peacfully in the forest.
